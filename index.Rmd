# Hi, I'm Preston

Hi, I’m Preston! I’m a junior at UT Austin studying Statistics & Data Science with a minor in Computer Science and Sports Analytics. I’m really interested in sports, tech, and finding fun ways to mix the two. Outside of classes, I like working on side projects, hanging out with friends, and exploring Austin whenever I get the chance.
