# SDS 375 - Homework 1 Site

This is a minimal starter for a GitHub Pages site built from **index.Rmd**.

## Quick start

1. Replace the image at `img/PLACEHOLDER.txt` with your own photo/image file (e.g., `img/me.jpg`).
2. Open the project folder in RStudio and knit `index.Rmd` to create `index.html`.
3. Commit & push to the repo named `USERNAME.github.io` (or to any repo that you configure for Pages from the `/docs` folder).
4. Visit `https://USERNAME.github.io/` (or `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/` if using the `/docs` option).
